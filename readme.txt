== Installation ==

1. Upload `super-simple-quotes.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I let other users besides the administrator use this? =

Users need to have the `manage_options` capability and Administrator is the only role with this capability in a vanilla WordPress-installation. You are encouraged to try Justin Tadlock's Members-plugin to add the `manage_options` capability to more roles to grant access to this plugin (and more, most likely).
